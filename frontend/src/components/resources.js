            <p>
                Learning about the symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) is crucial because they can arise at any point during the perinatal period and vary widely among individuals. Recognizing signs like anger, irritability, disinterest in the baby, sleep and appetite disruptions, sadness, guilt, and loss of pleasure in activities can help identify PPD early. Understanding these symptoms promotes awareness and empathy, which are essential for supporting new mothers and ensuring they receive timely care. Early intervention can prevent the escalation of feelings like hopelessness or thoughts of harm, which can significantly impact the health and safety of both mother and baby.
                Symptoms can start anytime during the perinatal period and they may differ for each person.
                <p class="bold">They might include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feelings of anger, irritability and/or rage</li>
                    <li>Lack of interest in the baby</li>
                    <li>Disturbances of sleep and appetite</li>
                    <li>Crying and sadness</li>
                    <li>Feelings of guilt, shame or hopelessness</li>
                    <li>Loss of interest, joy or pleasure in things you used to enjoy</li>
                    <li>Possible thoughts of harming the baby or yourself</li>
                </ul>

            <summary class="bold">Risk Factors</summary>
            <p>
                Understanding risk factors for PPD is essential, as it helps expectant and new parents identify vulnerabilities early and seek necessary support. Factors such as a personal or family history of mental health conditions, inadequate support, financial stress, marital issues, and recent major life events can increase the risk of perinatal depression. Additionally, pregnancy complications, NICU stays, and high-stress parenting groups (like military families, single parents, and parents of multiples) may further elevate this risk. Discussing these risk factors with a medical provider enables proactive planning, which can improve outcomes for both parent and child by addressing mental health needs and building supportive networks.
                Research shows that the items listed below may put you at a higher risk for perinatal depression. It is important to discuss your risk factors with your medical provider so that you can plan ahead for the care you may need.
                <p class="bold">Below are some common risk factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal or family history of mental health conditions, like depression, anxiety, perinatal depression, bipolar, or OCD.</li>
                    <li>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD or PMS) </li>
                    <li>Inadequate support in caring for the baby </li>
                    <li>Financial stress</li>
                    <li>History of Abuse</li>
                    <li>Marital stress</li>
                    <li>Unplanned Pregnancy</li>
                    <li>Unwanted Pregnancy</li>
                    <li>Complications in pregnancy, birth or lactation.</li>
                    <li>A major recent life event including: loss, moving or relocation, and job loss</li>
                    <li>Pregnancy and/or infant loss</li>
                    <li>Parents of  multiples</li>

                    <li>Any form of diabetes (type 1, type 2 or gestational)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">In addition, belonging to a high-stress parenting group may also be a risk factor.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>These groups might include:</li>
                    <li>Queer and Trans Families</li>
                    <li>Military Families</li>
